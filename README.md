# Lunaris-project
LUNARIS maps the Moon into ERC-721 NFTs linked to USGS geodata. Minting uses lunar phase algorithms and Chainlink VRF for rarity. Its triple-token system—MOONX (utility), LUNAR (governance), MOON-3 (premium)—is DAO-governed with modeled emissions. Participant authored protocol and verified data.
